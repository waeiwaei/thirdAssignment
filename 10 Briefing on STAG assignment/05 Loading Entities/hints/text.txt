To ensure that the basic entities file is in the correct location in the project folder and that it is a valid DOT file, we have provided a
<a href="resources/cw-stag/src/test/java/edu/uob/EntitiesFileTests.java" target="_blank">JUnit test class</a> for you to use.
Not only will these tests verify the basic entities file, but they also provides a clear illustration of the use of the JPGD library
for parsing DOT files.

A `.jar` file containing the JPGD library can be found in the `libs` folder of the maven template.
This _should_ already be part of the project dependencies, but it is useful to know where the library resides
(in case you have add it manually to your IntelliJ project).

Note that the `locations` subgraph will _always_ be **first** in the entities file and the `paths` subgraph will _always_
appear **after** the locations (the parser doesn't like it if we switch this ordering !)

You may assume that all entity files used during marking are in a valid format (our aim isn't to test the robustness of the parsing libraries).
