We have provided some example entity files for you to use in your project.
Firstly there is a <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/basic-entities.dot" target="_blank">basic entities file</a>
to help get you started in constructing your game engine.
We have also provided an <a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-entities.dot" target="_blank">extended entities file</a>
that can be used for more extensive testing during the later stages of your work.

You already have much experience of writing parsers from previous exercises (both on this unit and others).
We don't really want to cover old ground, so for this assignment you will NOT be required to build your own parser.
Instead, you are able to use existing parsing libraries for reading in the configuration files.
There is considerable educational value in learning to use existing libraries and frameworks in this way.

With this in mind, you should use the
<a href="http://www.alexander-merz.com/graphviz/doc/com/alexmerz/graphviz/Parser.html" target="_blank">JPGD parser</a>
in order to parse the entity DOT files. Use this library to extract a set of 
<a href="http://www.alexander-merz.com/graphviz/doc/com/alexmerz/graphviz/objects/package-summary.html" target="_blank">GraphViz Objects</a>
and then store them in a suitable data structure so that your server can access them.
We have provided you with an abstract `GameEntity` class in the maven project that you should use to represent entities within your game.
You should write a number of concrete subclasses that inherit from this abstract class to represent specific types of entity.

All entities will need at least a name and a description, some may need additional attributes as well.
To make things easier, entity names cannot contain spaces (the DOT parser doesn't like it if they do !).
It is also worth mentioning that entity names defined in the configuration files will be unique.
Additionally, there should only be a single instance of each entity within the game.
You won't have to deal with two things called `door` (although your might see a `blue_door` and a `red_door`).
As such, you can safely use entity names as unique identifiers.

Every game has a "special" location that is the starting point for an adventure.
The start location can be called anything we like, however it will _always_ be the **first** location
that appears in the "entities" file.

There is another special location called `storeroom` that can be found in the entities file.
This location does not appear in the game world (there will be no paths to/from it).
The `storeroom` is a container for all of the entities that have no initial location in the game.
Everything needs to exist somewhere in the game structure (so that they can be defined in the entities file).
These entities will not enter the game until an action places them into another location within the game.
