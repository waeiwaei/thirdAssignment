If you are feeling ambitious, extend your game so that it is able to operate with more than just a single player.
In order to support this feature, incoming command messages begin with the username of the player who issued that command.
For example, a "full" incoming message might therefore take the form of:
```
simon: open door with key
```

Where everything _before_ the first `:` is the player's name and everything _after_ is the command itself.
Valid player names can consist of uppercase and lowercase letters, spaces, apostrophes and hyphens.
Note that there is no "formal" player registration process - when the server encounters a command from
a previously unseen user, a new player should be created and placed in the start location of the game.

Note that there is no need for your server to implement any form of authentication - 
you can assume that the client handles this responsibility.
Your server should simply trust any commands that purport to come from a particular user.
This may seem unsafe, however this is intended to limit the scope and complexity of this assignment.

It is essential that when an incoming message is received, the command is applied to the _correct_ player.
To achieve this, you will need to maintain _some_ elements of game state _separately_ for each individual player.
For example, each player may be in a different location in the game and will carry their own inventory of artefacts.

One final thing to remember is that you should include _other_ players in your description of a location
when a `look` command is issued by a user. There is no point having multiple players in the game if they can't
actually _see_ each other ! Note that even though they can see each other, human players cannot interact directly.
This is because, due to dynamic player naming, it is not possible to write action rules involving player names
(since they are not known in advance of the game being played).
