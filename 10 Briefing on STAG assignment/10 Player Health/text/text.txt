As an extension to the basic game, you might like to add a "health level" feature.
Each player should start with the maximum health level of 3. Consumption of "Poisons & Potions" or interaction with beneficial
or dangerous characters will increase or decrease a player's health by one point. You will see in the 
<a href="resources/cw-stag/config/extended-actions.xml" target="_blank">extended actions file</a>
the use of the `health` keyword in the `produced` and `consumed` fields.
These indicate actions which increase and decrease your health by one unit.
Note that although a player's health can never increase above the maximum (i.e. 3)
actions producing health are still _performable_ but they will have no effect on the player's health level.

When a player's health runs out (i.e. when it becomes zero) they should lose all of the items in their inventory
(which are dropped in the location where they ran out of health).
The player should then be transported to the start location of the game and their health level restored to full (i.e. 3).
You might also like to send a suitable message to the user, for example:
```
you died and lost all of your items, you must return to the start of the game
```
It is important that you should not reset the whole game state when one player dies
(for example, previously opened location paths should still exist).
You should remember that there may be more than one player of the game - they shouldn't see their world change just
because another player has died.

In order to fully support these features in your game engine, you should implement a new `health` built-in command,
so that the player can keep track of their current health level. Upon receiving a `health` command from a user,
the server should report back the player's current health level (as a number).
